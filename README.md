## About my project

HardwareStore it is the first project I did with React. It is a hardware-oriented ecommerce. 
Here you can apply all the basic and most used concepts of the library, from state management to api calls, 
connection with firebase and much more.

I am very happy with this new project and I hope you like it too.
